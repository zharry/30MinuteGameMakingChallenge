# The Game

## Description
* A fun game/project that I did/made in grade 6 with GameMaker 8 with the use of some tutorials and default assets
* The compiled finished product is located in the "Binaries" folder, in this case, the one labeled "The Game (Working)" is the latest version updated to fix problems that I did not address back in grade 6 and the other is the original.
	
## How to play
"The Game" is a two player CTF/Shooter where the objective is to reach a certain point and/or kill the other player
* Frist two players are spawned in the bottom left and right corners of the map
* The left hand-side player uses "WASD" to move and "SPACE" to shoot arrows
* The right hand-side player uses Arrow Keys to move and "L" to shoot arrows
* Standing on the electric charging pad will regenerate your arrows
* In order to win without killing the other player, your only option is to collect the chest located in the center of the map
* The chest must be open in order for you to be able to "loot" it
* To open the chest you must first collect the scroll in the pathway above the chest room
* Colliding with the fast moving black bullets will not damage you but will instead teleport you back to your original spawn
